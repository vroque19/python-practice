Introduction to libraries
---------------------------

Module: a library with one or more functions/feautures built into it that is helpful with reusability of code.

example: random.choice(seq)
	- seq: sequence/list

"from random import choice" allows you to call the choice function without having to specify the scope by loading the function, choice, into the current namespace/scope of the current file im working in.
